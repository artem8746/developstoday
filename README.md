# Architecture Design: Node.js + React Error Logging Platform

## Client-Side SDK (Logging Library)
### Technology & Implementation:
We'll create a lightweight **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK** designed to be easily integrated into client applications (like React web apps or backend services built with Node.js). The SDK will capture **exceptions** and **context** (e.g., error messages, stack traces, user actions) and send them to the backend. It will automatically hook into global error handlers (like `window.onerror` and `window.onunhandledrejection` in browsers) to capture uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections. This means we can log any runtime errors in the application automatically without requiring explicit developer action. Developers can also manually log errors (using methods like `Logger.logError(error, context)`).

#### Features:
- **Batching & Transport:** The SDK will batch error logs and send them in groups using **HTTP(S)** requests via **Axios** or **Fetch**. For critical errors, we'll send them immediately, even before the app unloads, using **`navigator.sendBeacon`** for maximum reliability.
- **Non-blocking:** It’s designed to be **asynchronous** and **non-blocking**, ensuring that logging doesn't slow down the application. The log data is sent in the background without affecting the app's performance.
- **Configuration:** Developers can easily configure the SDK with an **API key** or **DSN** for authentication, set the server endpoint, and customize settings (like a sample rate to limit how often logs are sent).
- **Extensibility:** The SDK can be extended to work with **backend services** (like Node.js servers) or even **mobile apps**, ensuring the service is compatible with a variety of environments.

#### Justification:
We’ll build the SDK in **TypeScript** to ensure **type safety**, providing robust error handling and reducing bugs. By logging **all uncaught exceptions** by default, we ensure comprehensive error tracking. Advanced features like **breadcrumbs** (logging actions that lead to an error) will help with reproducing issues. This SDK prioritizes performance, so it won’t slow down the app but will ensure logs are delivered reliably.

## Backend Logging API (Node.js Service)
### Technology:
Our backend will be built with **Node.js** to handle **high concurrency**, allowing us to efficiently manage incoming logs. We’ll use **NestJS**, which is a modern, **modular framework** for building scalable applications. NestJS helps us organize our code and easily integrate with message queues, databases, and APIs. It’s built on **Express**, so it’s familiar and widely adopted.

#### Ingestion Endpoint:
The backend will expose a **REST API endpoint** (e.g., `POST /api/logs`) to receive log data from the SDK. When the backend receives a log event, it quickly **enqueues** it for further processing, using an internal **message queue** (e.g., **RabbitMQ** or **AWS SQS**). This decouples the log ingestion process from log processing, ensuring the API remains fast even when there’s a surge in incoming logs. The message queue buffers logs and ensures we don’t lose any data.

#### Processing & Worker Services:
A separate **worker process** (or a background task pool) will pull logs from the queue and process them. It will store the logs in a **database** (like **Elasticsearch**) and trigger alerts if needed. Separating the work into workers ensures that the main API can scale independently of the processing layer.

#### Data Model:
Each log entry will contain metadata like the timestamp, severity (e.g., error, warning), error message, stack trace, application version, environment, and user ID (if available). We’ll organize logs by **project/application ID** to support **multi-tenancy**, ensuring each client’s data is isolated. To group similar errors, we might calculate a **fingerprint** (hash) of the error message and stack trace.

#### API for Dashboard:
We’ll also expose **query APIs** for the React dashboard to retrieve logs and perform **analytics**. For example, developers can query logs based on severity, project ID, and date range. The backend will support **pagination** and **search indexing** to make queries faster and more efficient.

#### Security & Auth:
All endpoints will require authentication via **API keys** (for log submissions) or **JWTs** (for dashboard access). Communication will be over **HTTPS** to ensure secure data transfer. We will also validate incoming log data to prevent malicious content from being logged or stored.

## Database and Storage for Logs
### Choice of Database:
Given the high volume of log data, we need a **searchable NoSQL database**. We’ll use **Elasticsearch** (or its open-source alternative **OpenSearch**) to store and index the logs. **Elasticsearch** is optimized for high-velocity data and is ideal for **real-time search**, full-text querying, and **analytics**.

#### Data Management:
Logs will be stored as **JSON documents**, with fields like timestamp, error message, and stack trace indexed for search. We can use **time-based sharding** (e.g., creating new indexes monthly) to distribute data efficiently and optimize query performance.

#### Retention Policy:
To prevent the database from growing endlessly, we’ll implement **log retention policies**. For example, we can keep logs for the past **90 days** and then **archive** or **delete** older logs. For archives, we can move old logs to **cheaper storage** (e.g., **AWS S3**) to save space while maintaining accessibility.

## Web Dashboard (React Front-End)
### Technology:
The dashboard will be built with **React**, a modern, component-based library that’s perfect for creating interactive user interfaces. React allows us to efficiently manage the UI state and provides an intuitive framework for building dynamic components like tables, filters, and graphs.

#### Features:
- **Error Listing & Search:** The dashboard will display logs, with filters for things like **severity**, **date range**, and **project**.
- **Error Details:** Clicking an error will show full details, including the stack trace and context information (e.g., environment, user actions leading up to the error).
- **Aggregation & Charts:** The dashboard will include visualizations like error trends (e.g., number of errors per day) and breakdowns (e.g., errors by type, by browser).
- **Project Settings:** Developers can define what constitutes a **critical error**, configure **API keys**, and add team members for **alert notifications**.

---

## Real-Time Error Notifications
For critical errors, the platform will send **real-time notifications** to alert developers immediately.

#### Triggering Alerts:
The backend will monitor logs for **critical errors** and automatically send alerts via **email** (using **AWS SES** or **SendGrid**). We’ll also implement the ability to group similar errors into a single notification to avoid overwhelming developers with repeated alerts.

#### Real-Time vs. Batch:
While most logs will be processed in batches, **critical errors** will be sent immediately to the developers. We’ll also use **event-driven processing** to make sure that any spike in errors is handled in near real-time.

---

## DevOps and Deployment Strategy
### Containerization & Orchestration:
We’ll use **Docker** to containerize our backend services and deploy them in a **Kubernetes** cluster for **scalability** and **fault tolerance**. Kubernetes will manage multiple instances of the API and worker processes, allowing the system to handle high volumes of logs without downtime.

### CI/CD Pipeline:
We’ll automate the deployment process with a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitLab CI** or **GitHub Actions**. When code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline will:
1. Run unit and integration tests.
2. Build Docker images for both the frontend and backend.
3. Deploy the app to Kubernetes.

### Scalable Hosting:
The app will be hosted on a cloud provider like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**. We’ll use managed services for Elasticsearch and AWS SQS to reduce operational overhead and ensure **reliability**.

### Monitoring & Alerting:
We’ll implement **monitoring** with tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, which will track **system health** (e.g., API response times, database performance). If any component goes down or experiences performance issues, alerts will be triggered to notify the team.

## Key Questions for Requirement Clarification
1. **Scale & Throughput:** How many log events do we expect the system to handle per day/second, especially during peak times?
2. **Environment Support:** Should we extend the SDK to handle **Node.js backends** and **mobile apps** from the start?
3. **Critical Error Definition:** How should we define a "critical" error for real-time notifications? Is this based on error type or severity level?
4. **Notification Preferences:** Are there any additional notification channels (SMS, Slack, etc.) that we should support in the future?
5. **Log Retention:** How long should logs be stored by default? Should we offer configurable retention periods?
6. **Performance Expectations:** Are there any specific **performance SLAs** for query speeds (e.g., dashboard loading times)?
7. **Security:** What level of **data encryption** and **privacy** controls should we implement, especially for sensitive error data?
8. **SDK for Backend or Frontend:** SDK will be used on Backend services or on Frontend also?
